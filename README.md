Customization for Arch Linux. Details inside. (Work in Progress)

### Basic information:

* Window Manager: i3 - wm
* Shell: zsh
* Terminal emulator: Terminator
* Text Editor: Vim
* Web Browser: Chromium

## Window Manager
Our window manager of choice is going to be i3. This is a tiling window manager, which means that
any opened window is going to occupy a predefined space. If a new window is opened, the windows
are going to tile the screen, giving equal space to each window. 

## Shell
We're giving zsh a go. We're using oh-my-zsh for the initial set-up. Any further customizations
are individual.

## Terminal Emulator

## Text Editor

## Web Browser
